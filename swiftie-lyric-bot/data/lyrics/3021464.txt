This Here Guitar Lyrics[Verse 1]
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Verse 2]
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Bridge]
Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar
