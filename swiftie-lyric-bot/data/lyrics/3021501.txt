Welcome Distraction Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy when I let too much go
Love’s a little messy, and you are too
Right now, I’m scared of both of you
I laugh, and I play, and I wasn’t gonna stray
Swore I’d never let a man in my way
You’re the last thing I needed today

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Verse 2]
Gone and spilled my coffee tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you, you just never know
Can’t talk to my friends without you coming up
It’s even kind of cute the way you cuss
I wrote your name down a hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good right next to mine
You’re the last thing I needed tonight

And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

[Bridge]
I’m acting like a girl with nothing to lose
When did I stop caring about anything but you?

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

[Outro]
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction, oh, oh
